Consider the instrument’s internal resistance — it can affect readings. Use differential probes for high-voltage or floating measurements. In high-precision systems, calibration and shielding are crucial. The Beauty of Measurement Electrical measurement isn’t just technical — it’s poetic in a way.\nYou’re quantifying something that cannot be seen, only felt through instruments.\nEach reading tells a story — of motion, resistance, balance, and transformation.\n“To measure is to know. If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it.”\n— Lord Kelvin\nLooking Ahead 🔭 In upcoming articles, I’ll explore:\nThe theory and use of bridges (Wheatstone, Kelvin, Maxwell) Error and uncertainty analysis in instrumentation How to design and calibrate measurement systems for embedded and biomedical applications Stay tuned — because the journey from volts and amps to insight and control is just beginnin\n","date":"2025-10-15T12:00:00+05:30","permalink":"http://localhost:41609/souren-profile/understanding-electrical-measurements-the-language-of-circuits/","title":"Understanding Electrical Measurements — The Language of Circuits"},{"content":"The Frugality of Life 🌿 We live in a world that constantly whispers, “More.”\nMore things. More success. More validation.\nBut what if the secret to a fulfilling life lies not in adding, but in subtracting?\nFrugality isn’t about deprivation. It’s about deliberation — choosing consciously where our time, energy, and money flow. It’s about aligning our lives with what actually brings peace and purpose, rather than chasing what sparkles for a moment and fades the next.\nThe Essence of Frugality Frugality begins with gratitude.\nWhen we recognize what we already have — the warmth of morning light, a calm cup of tea, a kind word — we stop searching frantically for more.\nWe start to see abundance in simplicity.\nLiving frugally teaches us that:\nEvery possession has a hidden cost — of space, attention, and care. Every purchase is a vote for the kind of world we want to build. Every act of restraint sharpens appreciation for what remains. Beyond Money To be frugal in life is not just to spend less — it’s to waste less:\nLess time in distraction. Less energy on resentment. Less emotion on things outside our control. It’s an act of quiet rebellion against the chaos of consumption.\nA way to reclaim sovereignty over our own minds.\nThe Joy of Enough There’s a quiet joy in realizing that enough is a moving boundary we can choose to stop chasing.\nEnough clothes.\nEnough gadgets.\nEnough goals.\nWhen “enough” settles in the heart, contentment follows naturally.\nClosing Thoughts 🌸 Frugality isn’t an aesthetic — it’s a mindset.\nIt’s not about living less, but about living lightly, with clarity and purpose.\n“The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it.”\n— Henry David Thoreau\nHere’s to a life not cluttered by possessions, but enriched by perspective.\n– Souren\n","date":"2025-10-15T11:00:00+05:30","permalink":"http://localhost:41609/souren-profile/p/the-frugality-of-life-finding-grace-in-simplicity/","title":"The Frugality of Life — Finding Grace in Simplicity"},{"content":"Welcome to My Blog 🌱 Hey there — and welcome!\nThis is the very first post on my Hugo-powered blog, and I couldn’t be more excited to finally hit publish.\nI’ve been meaning to start this space for a while — a place where I can write, explore ideas, and share what I’m learning along the way. Whether it’s about technology, engineering, personal projects, or just random reflections, this blog is going to be my digital notebook — open to anyone curious enough to read.\nWhy I Started This Blog There’s something powerful about putting thoughts into words. Writing forces clarity, and clarity builds growth.\nI wanted a clean, fast, and minimal platform — so Hugo felt like the perfect fit. It’s lightweight, Markdown-based, and gives me full control over how my content looks and behaves.\nWhat You Can Expect Here Over time, I plan to post about:\n💻 Tech experiments \u0026amp; coding projects ⚙️ Engineering, electronics, and system design 📚 Notes from books, ideas, and experiences 💡 Occasional deep dives into things I find fascinating This blog isn’t about perfection — it’s about progress and sharing.\nA Note on Simplicity In a world full of noisy feeds and endless scrolling, I want this site to feel different —\na quiet, thoughtful space to pause, learn, and build together.\nIf you’re reading this, you’re already part of that journey. So, thank you.\nUntil Next Time 👋 I’ll be posting regularly, so stay tuned for updates.\nIf you’d like to connect or share ideas, feel free to drop a comment or reach out through the contact page.\nSee you in the next post —\nSouren\n“The first step doesn’t have to be perfect — it just has to be taken.”\n","date":"2025-10-15T10:00:00+05:30","permalink":"http://localhost:41609/souren-profile/p/welcome-to-my-blog-a-fresh-beginning/","title":"Welcome to My Blog — A Fresh Beginning"},{"content":"Stack has built-in support for math typesetting using KaTeX.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not enabled by default side-wide, but you can enable it for individual posts by adding math: true to the front matter.
